# C-plus-plus Student-Class Lab
This Program demonstrates the use of classes in C++. The Student class is instantiated three times using three separate constructors; one default, and two overloaded. The program will output the name, id, and test scores for each object created from the Student class via mutator and accessor functions while validating along the way.
